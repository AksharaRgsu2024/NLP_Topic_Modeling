Topic Modeling is a Deep Learning technique for automatically extracting common themes from a set of unstructured text documents using NLP.
The aim is to cluster similar documents together, using important keywords. It assumes that a topic is a probability distribution over the vocabulary.

The different techniques tested for topic modeling are:
- Bag of Words and LDA
- TFIDF and LDA
- N Gram and LDA
- Doc2Vec and Kmeans
